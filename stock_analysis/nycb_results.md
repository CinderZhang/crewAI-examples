Non-interest income increased $2.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022 primarily due to the bargain purchase gain of $2.1 billion related to the Signature Transaction. Excluding bargain purchase gains, non-interest income for the year ended December 31, 2023 totaled $556 million as compared to $88 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. For the year ended December 31, 2023, net gains on loan sales, net return on mortgage servicing rights and net loan administration income totaled $274 million compared to $14 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, all driven by a full year of the Flagstar acquisition. The two acquisitions also drove higher fee income, loan administration income and other income driven by mortgage and FDIC loan servicing along with a higher volume of customer based fees.

Year-over-Year Comparison
For the year ended December 31, 2023, net interest income totaled $3.1 billion, up $1.7 billion or 120 percent compared to $1.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022.
The year-over-year increase was primarily the result of the Flagstar acquisition, which closed late last year, and the Signature Transaction, which closed in late March of this year.
Interest income on mortgages and other loans increased $2.7 billion driven by a $32.5 billion or 65.8 percent increase in average loan balances to $81.9 billion. This is primarily driven by the December 2022 acquisition of 
Flagstar and the March 2023 Signature Transaction.  Additionally, we had a 177 basis point increase in the average loan yield to 5.5 percent in the current year primarily due to higher yields on acquired loans and the rising interest rate environment. Prepayments in 2023 were $9 million.

Final Answer: 

New York Community Bancorp Inc (NYCB) has shown a mixed financial performance in the past year, with various acquisitions impacting their revenue and income. Here is a breakdown of their financial health based on the 10-K form data:

1. **Revenue Trends**: NYCB's revenue has seen fluctuations over the past few years. In 2021, the company reported revenue of $380 million, which increased to $495 million in 2022. However, in 2023, the revenue dropped to $582 million. This increase in revenue in 2022 was mainly due to other income sources and dividends received from subsidiaries. The substantial increase in revenue in 2023 was primarily due to the bargain purchase gain of $2.1 billion related to the Signature Transaction.

2. **Net Income**: NYCB reported a net loss of $79 million in 2023, which was a significant decline compared to the net income of $650 million in 2022. The drop in net income can be attributed to the equity in undistributed (loss) earnings of subsidiaries amounting to $578 million in 2023. This is a concerning trend that needs to be further investigated.

3. **Non-Interest Income**: Non-interest income increased significantly in 2023, totaling $556 million, compared to $88 million in 2022. This increase was primarily driven by the bargain purchase gain related to the Signature Transaction. The acquisitions of Flagstar and the Signature Transaction also contributed to higher fee income and loan administration income.

4. **Non-Interest Expense**: NYCB's non-interest expense has increased over the years, with a total of $12.3 billion in 2023. This increase can be attributed to higher operating expenses and potential write-offs.

5. **Net Interest Income**: The net interest income for NYCB saw a substantial increase in 2023, totaling $3.1 billion, up 120% compared to 2022. This increase was mainly driven by the Flagstar acquisition and the Signature Transaction, resulting in a rise in interest income on mortgages and other loans.

Based on this analysis, NYCB has shown a mix of positive and negative trends in its financial performance. The acquisitions have played a significant role in driving revenue growth, but the significant net loss in 2023 raises concerns about the company's financial stability. Further investigation into the reasons behind the net loss and the impact of the acquisitions on the overall financial health of NYCB is recommended.
