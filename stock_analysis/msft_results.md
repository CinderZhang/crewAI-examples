Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) is a tech giant that has shown significant growth and revenue increases in the past year. The company's revenue for Fiscal Year 2023 compared to Fiscal Year 2022 increased by $13.6 billion or 7%. This growth was primarily driven by the Intelligent Cloud and Productivity and Business Processes segments, offset by a decline in More Personal Computing.
