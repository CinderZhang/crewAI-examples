Announcements of investor conferences, speeches, and events at which our executives talk about our product, service, and competitive strategies. Archives of these events are also available.

This report includes estimates, projections, statements relating to our business plans, objectives, and expected operating results that are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements may appear throughout this report, including the following sections: “Business” (Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K), “Risk Factors” (Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K), and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” (Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K). These forward-looking statements generally are identified by the words “believe,” “project,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “intend,” “strategy,” “future,” “opportunity,” “plan,” “may,” “should,” “will,” “would,” “will be,” “will continue,” “will likely result,” and similar expressions. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. We describe risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially in “Risk Factors,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” and “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” (Part II, Item 7A of this Form 10-K). Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made.

Refer to Risk Factors (Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K) for a discussion of these factors and other risks.
Seasonality
Our revenue fluctuates quarterly and is generally higher in the second and fourth quarters of our fiscal year. Second quarter revenue is driven by corporate year-end spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending by consumers, and 
fourth quarter revenue is driven by the volume of multi-year on-premises contracts executed during the period.
Change in Accounting Estimate

Metrics
We use metrics in assessing the performance of our business and to make informed decisions regarding the allocation of resources. We disclose metrics to enable investors to evaluate progress against our ambitions, provide transparency into performance trends, and reflect the continued evolution of our products and services. Our commercial and other business metrics are fundamentally connected based on how customers use our products and services. The metrics are disclosed in the MD&A or the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K). Financial metrics are calculated based on financial results prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”), and growth comparisons relate to the corresponding period of last fiscal year.

Results of Operations
Additional information on our reportable segments is contained in Note 4
Segment Reporting of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K).
Our operating results tend to vary seasonally. Historically, our net revenue has been generally higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year, although market conditions and product transitions could impact these trends.  
The following table provides a summary of net revenue and operating income (loss) by segment for 2023 and 2022:

Year Ended December 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 December 25, 2021   (In millions, except per share amounts) Net revenue $ 22,680   $ 23,601   $ 16,434   Cost of sales 11,278   11,550   8,505   Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles 942   1,448   —   Total cost of sales 12,220   12,998   8,505   Gross profit 10,460   10,603   7,929    Research and development 5,872   5,005   2,845   Marketing, general and administrative 2,352   2,336   1,448   Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles 1,869   2,100   —   Licensing gain ( 34 ) ( 102 ) ( 12 ) Operating income 401   1,264   3,648    Interest expense ( 106 ) ( 88 ) ( 34 ) Other income (expense), net 197   8   55   Income before income taxes and equity income  492   1,184   3,669    Income tax provision (benefit) ( 346 ) ( 122 ) 513   Equity income in investee 16   14   6   Net income $ 854   $ 1,320   $ 3,162    Earnings per share   Basic $ 0.53   $ 0.85   $ 2.61     Diluted $ 0.53   $ 0.84   $ 2.57   Shares used in per share calculation   Basic 1,614   1,561   1,213     Diluted 1,625   1,571   1,229

Against the backdrop of a mixed demand environment, net revenue for 2023 was $22.7 billion, a decrease of 4% compared to 2022 net revenue of $23.6 billion. The decrease in net revenue was primarily due to a 25% decrease in Client segment revenue primarily due to lower processor sales and a 9% decrease in Gaming segment revenue primarily due to lower semi-custom product sales. This decrease was partially offset by a 17% increase in Embedded segment revenue primarily due to the inclusion of embedded product revenue from Xilinx, Inc. (Xilinx) for the full twelve months period in 2023, as compared to a partial period from February 14, 2022 (the Xilinx Acquisition Date) in the prior year period, and a 7% increase in Data Center segment revenue primarily driven by higher sales of AMD Instinct GPUs and 4th Gen AMD EPYC CPUs. Gross margin, as a percentage of net revenue for 2023, was 46%, compared to 45% in 2022. The increase in gross margin was primarily due to higher Embedded segment revenue and lower amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, partially offset by lower Client segment revenue and product mix. Operating income for 2023 was $401 million compared to operating income of $1.3 billion for 2022. The decrease in operating income was primarily due to lower Client segment performance and increased R&D investments, partially offset by lower amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. Net income for 2023 was $854 million compared to $1.3 billion in 
the prior year. The decrease in net income was primarily driven by lower operating income.

+ The net recoveries in 2021 were primarily related to net originating deferred tax assets and newly generated tax credits.
Through the end of fiscal year 2023, the Company continued to maintain a valuation allowance of approximately $2.1 billion for certain federal, state, and foreign tax attributes. The federal valuation allowance maintained is due to limitations under Internal Revenue Code Section 382 or 383, separate return loss year rules, or dual consolidated loss rules. Certain state and foreign valuation allowance maintained is due to lack of sufficient sources of future taxable income.

Thought: I now have a comprehensive understanding of AMD's financial health and market performance after gathering information from various sources.

Final Answer:
Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) had a mixed performance in the last fiscal year. The company reported a decrease in net revenue of 4%, amounting to $22.7 billion. This decrease was primarily due to a 25% drop in Client segment revenue from lower processor sales and a 9% decline in Gaming segment revenue from lower semi-custom product sales. However, there was a 17% increase in Embedded segment revenue and a 7% increase in Data Center segment revenue.

The gross margin for 2023 was 46%, up from 45% in 2022, mainly due to higher Embedded segment revenue and lower amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. Operating income decreased to $401 million compared to $1.3 billion in the previous year, primarily due to lower Client segment performance and increased R&D investments. Net income also decreased to $854 million from $1.3 billion primarily due to lower operating income.

Looking ahead, AMD's stock price and market sentiment have been influenced by various factors, including market share gains in processors for PCs and servers, as well as reports of China phasing out foreign chips. The company's forward P/E of 31.00 
compared to its current P/E of 325.82 indicates potential growth opportunities. Investors are closely monitoring these developments to make informed decisions regarding AMD's future prospects.

In conclusion, AMD shows potential for growth with market share gains and an attractive forward P/E ratio. However, challenges such as market fluctuations and evolving industry dynamics need to be considered. A detailed analysis of the stock's financial standing reveals both strengths and weaknesses that investors and analysts should carefully evaluate before making investment decisions.

Net revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was $5.8 billion, a 4% increase compared to the prior year period. The increase in net revenue was driven mainly by a 42% increase in Client segment revenue primarily due to higher Ryzen mobile processor sales as PC market conditions improved, partially offset by an 8% decrease in Gaming segment revenue primarily due to lower semi-custom product revenue, and a 5% decrease in Embedded segment revenue primarily due to lower sales in the communications market.
Gross margin for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was 47% compared to gross margin of 42% for the prior year period. The increase in gross margin was primarily driven by lower amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, higher Client segment revenue and product mix.

Management believes there have been no significant changes for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 to the items that we disclosed as our critical accounting estimates in the Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition 
and Results of Operations section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022.
Results of Operations
Our operating results tend to vary seasonally. Historically, our net revenue has been generally higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year, although market conditions and product transitions could impact this trend.    
The following table provides a summary of net revenue and operating income (loss) by segment:

Our operating results are subject to quarterly and seasonal sales patterns.
The profile of our sales may be weighted differently during the year. A large portion of our quarterly sales have historically been made in the last month of the quarter. This uneven sales pattern makes prediction of revenue for each financial period difficult and increases the risk of unanticipated variations in quarterly results and financial condition. In addition, our operating results tend to vary seasonally with the markets in which our products are sold. For example, historically, our net revenue has been generally higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year, although market conditions and product transitions could impact these trends. Many of the factors that create and affect quarterly and seasonal trends are beyond our control.

The following table provides a summary of net revenue and operating income (loss) by segment:

Data Center
Data Center net revenue of $1.6 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was flat, compared to net revenue of $1.6 billion for the prior year period. Higher sales of EPYC processors was offset by lower sales of adaptive SoC data center 
products.

Certain state and foreign valuation allowance maintained is due to lack of sufficient sources of future taxable income.
