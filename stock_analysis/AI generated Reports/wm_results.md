Current Year Financial Results

Conversely, certain destructive weather and climate conditions, such as wildfires in the Western U.S. and hurricanes that most often impact our operations in the Southern and Eastern U.S. during the second half of the year, can increase our revenues in the geographic areas affected as a result of the waste volumes generated by these events. While weather-related and other event-driven special projects can boost revenues through additional work for a limited time, due to significant start-up costs and other factors, such revenue can generate earnings at comparatively lower margins.
Net operating revenues relating to operations for the year ended December 31 are as follows (in millions):
​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​      2023      2022      2021 U.S. ​ $   19,595 ​ $   18,860 ​ $   17,136 Canada  ​     813 ​     838 ​     795 Other (a)  ​     18 ​    — ​    — Total ​ $   20,426 ​ $   19,698 ​ $   17,931

Key elements of our 2023 financial results include:
Revenues of $20,426 million for 2023 compared with $19,698 million in 2022, an increase of $728 million, or 3.7%. The increase is primarily attributable to (i) higher yield in our Collection and Disposal businesses; (ii) acquisitions, net of divestitures and (iii) increased volumes. These increases were partially offset by commodity price declines in our Recycling Processing and Sales and WM Renewable Energy segments and decreased revenue from our energy surcharge program as a result of a decline in the price of fuel, particularly diesel;

(a) Calculated by dividing the increase or decrease for the current year by the prior year’s related business revenue adjusted to exclude the impacts of divestitures for the current year.
(b) Calculated by dividing the increase or decrease for the current year by the prior year’s total Company revenue adjusted to exclude the impacts of divestitures for the current year.
(c) Includes combined impact of commodity price variability in both our Recycling Processing and Sales and WM Renewable Energy segments, as well as changes in certain recycling fees charged by our collection and disposal operations.
(d) Beginning in 2023, the results include changes in our revenue attributable to our WM Renewable Energy segment. Previously these changes in revenue were included in energy surcharges and mandated fees. We have revised our prior year results to conform with the current year presentation.

Thought: I now have gathered valuable information on Waste Management's financial performance for the past year from the 10-K form. I need to continue analyzing other key financial metrics and market trends to provide a comprehensive report.

Key elements of our financial results for the third quarter include:
Revenues of $5,198 million, compared with $5,075 million in the prior year period, an increase of $123 million, or 2.4%. The increase is primarily attributable to (i) higher yield in our collection and disposal business; (ii) acquisitions, net of divestitures and (iii) increased volumes. These increases were partially offset by commodity price declines in our recycling and WM Renewable Energy businesses and decreased revenue from our energy surcharge program as a result of a decline in the price of fuel, particularly diesel;

During the third quarter of 2023, we continued to focus on our priorities to advance our strategy—growing price to offset cost inflation, enhancing employee engagement, permanently reducing our cost to serve through the use of technology and automation, and investing in growth through our recycling and WM Renewable Energy businesses. This strategic focus, combined with strong operational execution resulted in increased revenue, income from operations and income from operations margin during the third quarter of 2023. We remain diligent in offering a competitive and differentiated service that meets the needs of our customers, and are focused on driving operating efficiencies and reducing discretionary spend. We continue to invest in our 
people through market wage adjustments, investments in our digital platform and training for our team members. We also continue to make investments in automation and optimization to enhance our operational efficiency and improve labor productivity for all lines of business. During the third quarter of 2023, we allocated $673 million of available cash to capital expenditures and $653 million to our shareholders through dividends and common stock repurchases.
