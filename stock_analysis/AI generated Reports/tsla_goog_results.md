In 2023, we recognized total revenues of $96.77 billion, representing an increase of $15.31 billion, compared to the prior year. We continue to ramp production, build new manufacturing capacity and expand our operations to 
enable increased deliveries and deployments of our products, and invest in research and development to accelerate our AI, software and fleet-based profits for further revenue growth.
In 2023, our net income attributable to common stockholders was $15.00 billion, representing a favorable change of $2.44 billion, compared to the prior year. This included a one-time non-cash tax benefit of $5.93 billion for the release of valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets. We continue to focus on further cost reductions and operational efficiencies while maximizing delivery volumes.

Cost of automotive leasing revenue decreased $241 million, or 16%, in the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in direct sales-type leasing cost of revenue driven by lower deliveries year over year.
Cost of services and other revenue increased $1.95 billion, or 33%, in the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was generally in line with the changes in services and other revenue as discussed above.
Gross margin for total automotive decreased from 28.5% to 19.4% in the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease was primarily due to a lower average selling price on our vehicles partially offset by the favorable change in our average combined cost per unit of our vehicles and IRA manufacturing credits earned as discussed above.

Final Answer: 

Tesla's (TSLA) 10-K form for the year ended December 31, 2023, reveals significant growth in total revenues, reaching $96.77 billion, a notable increase from the previous year. The company attributes this growth to production ramp-up, expansion of operations, and investments in research and development. Net income attributable to common stockholders also saw a substantial rise to $15.00 billion, reflecting a favorable change of $2.44 billion 
compared to the prior year, including a one-time non-cash tax benefit.

The breakdown of revenues shows that automotive sales accounted for $78.51 billion, energy generation and storage contributed $6.04 billion, and services and other revenues were $8.32 billion. Gross profit stood at $17.66 billion, with operating expenses totaling $8.77 billion, resulting in income from operations of $8.89 billion.

Furthermore, the 10-K form highlights the company's cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities. Operating activities generated significant cash flow of $13.26 billion, while investing activities showed a net cash outflow of $15.58 billion, primarily due to purchases of property and equipment. Financing activities contributed positively to cash flow with a net increase of $2.59 billion.

Overall, Tesla's financial performance in 2023 demonstrates robust revenue growth, improved net income, and effective cost management strategies. The company's focus on innovation, expansion, and operational efficiency bodes well for its future growth prospects in the electric vehicle industry.

Revenues were $307.4 billion, an increase of 9% year over year, primarily driven by an increase in Google Services revenues of $19.0 billion, or 8%, and an increase in Google Cloud revenues of $6.8 billion, or 26%.
Total constant currency revenues, which exclude the effect of hedging, increased 10% year over year.
Cost of revenues was $133.3 billion, an increase of 6% year over year, primarily driven by increases in content acquisition costs, compensation expenses, and TAC. The increase in compensation expenses included charges related to employee severance associated with the reduction in our workforce. Additionally, cost of revenues benefited from a reduction in depreciation due to the change in estimated useful lives of our servers and network equipment.

Revenue Backlog

Revenue Backlog
As of December 31, 2023, we had $74.1 billion of remaining performance obligations (“revenue backlog”), primarily related to Google Cloud. Our revenue backlog represents commitments in customer contracts for future services that have not yet been recognized as revenue. The estimated revenue backlog and timing of revenue recognition for these commitments is largely driven by our ability to deliver in accordance with relevant contract terms and when our customers utilize services. We expect to recognize approximately half of the revenue backlog as revenues over the next 24 months with the remaining to be recognized thereafter. Revenue backlog includes related deferred revenue currently recorded as well as amounts that will be invoiced in future periods, and excludes contracts with an original expected term of one year or less and cancellable contracts.
Deferred Revenues

Capital expenditures, which primarily reflected investments in technical infrastructure, were $32.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023.
As of December 31, 2023, we had 182,502 employees.

Total constant currency revenues of $76.3 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2023 increased $7.8 billion compared to $68.5 billion in revenues, excluding hedging effect, for the three months ended September 30, 2022.
EMEA revenue growth was favorably affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily due to the U.S. dollar weakening relative to the Euro and to a lesser extent the British pound, partially offset by the U.S. dollar strengthening relative to the Turkish lira.
APAC revenue growth was unfavorably affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily due to the U.S. dollar strengthening relative to the Japanese yen.
Other Americas revenue growth was unfavorably affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily due to the U.S. dollar strengthening relative to the Argentine peso.

Revenues and Monetization Metrics
We generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising; cloud-based solutions that provide enterprise customers of all sizes with infrastructure and platform services as well as communication and collaboration tools; sales of other products and services, such as apps and in-app purchases, and hardware; and fees received for subscription-based products. For details on how we recognize revenue, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022.
In addition to the long-term trends and their financial effect on our business noted in "Trends in Our Business and Financial Effect" in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, fluctuations in our revenues have been and may continue to be affected by a combination of factors, including:

Operating cash flow was $30.7 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2023, which reflects the 2023 IRS payment deferral relief made available to taxpayers headquartered in designated counties in California. On October 16, 2023, we made an estimated income tax payment to the IRS of $10.5 billion that will be reflected in our fourth quarter operating cash flow.
Capital expenditures, which primarily reflected investments in technical infrastructure, were $8.1 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2023.
As of September 30, 2023, we had 182,381 employees. Substantially all of the employees affected by the reduction of our workforce were no longer included in our headcount as of September 30, 2023.

I need to gather information from both the 10-Q and 10-K forms of Alphabet Inc to provide a detailed summary of their financial performance, including revenue, operating cash flow, capital expenditures, and employee count. 
I should start by searching for the relevant data in the SEC filings.

Action: Search 10-Q form
Action Input: {"ticker": "GOOGL", "question": "What was last quarter's revenue, operating cash flow, capital expenditures, and employee count?"} 

I encountered an error while trying to use the tool. This was the error: SECTools.search_10q() got an unexpected keyword argument 'ticker'.
 Tool Search 10-Q form accepts these inputs: Search 10-Q form(data) - Useful to search information from the latest 10-Q form for a

    The input to this tool should be a pipe (|) separated text of
